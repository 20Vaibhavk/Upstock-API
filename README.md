# Upstock-API

This repository contains a Python script for integrating with the Upstox API to fetch holdings, place orders, and subscribe to a WebSocket feed for real-time updates. The fetched data is stored in a MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

- Python installed on your system.
- Required Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pymysql requests websocket-client
    ```

- An Upstox API key and access token. You can obtain these from the Upstox developer portal.

- MySQL installed on your system or access to a MySQL database.

## Configuration

1. Update the MySQL connection configuration in the script (`mysql_config`) with your MySQL server details.

2. Replace `'your_upstox_api_key'` and `'actual_access_token_value_here'` with your Upstox API key and access token respectively.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Upstox-API.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd upstox-api-integration
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python upstox_integration.py
    ```

4. The script will fetch holdings, save them to the MySQL database, and subscribe to the WebSocket feed for real-time updates.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your Upstox API key and access token are kept secure. It's recommended to use environment variables or a configuration file to store sensitive information.

- Add error handling and logging to enhance the robustness of the script.

- Test the script thoroughly before using it in a production environment.
